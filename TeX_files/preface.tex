\chapter{Author's Note and Disclaimer}

This is a collection of notes on the Standard Model of Particle Physics. All contents of this work will mainly follow the chosen textbook references. I do not claim to present any new discoveries in this work, but I will do my best to provide my personal insights on each topics to be included in this work.

First, we try to digest the discussions presented in \emph{A Standard Model Workbook} by \textit{Thomas A. Moore}, starting with the 4th chapter of the workbook. Then, we will built upon this to dive deeper on the presented topics using different textbooks such as \emph{Modern Particle Physics} by \textit{Mark Thomson}, \emph{Quantum Field Theory for the Gifted Amateur} by \textit{Stephen Blundell} and \textit{Tom Lancaster}.

This will surely take me $n$-years to finish. Wish me luck.

I am open to possible discussions and more than willing to accept guidance in this lifelong endeavor.
